    <h1>SOC09108 - 2015 - Practical 01</h1>
    <p>This year, this module starts with a practical. We will therefore use this space to introduce the module and get started with the technical basics.</p>
    <h2><a id="Introduction_to_the_module_3"></a>Introduction to the module</h2>
    <p>This module is a professional practice, with the given purpose of introducing Content Management Systems to you in a way you can become a proficient professional working with them on a day to day basis. We will cover content on how to install and manage them in a professional way, and how we can extend them to fit with companies requirements.</p>
    <p>This module will be technical and cover a large set of tools, from Integrated Development Environments and text editors, to versionning and CMSs. It also requires the use of different languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.</p>
    <p>You will have two assessments at the end: a practical assessment where you will have to develop a website with WordPress, and a academic assessment where you will write an essay comparing different CMSs.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, anyone can get a good mark from this module. Whereas it may appear as trivial, we will ask from you a good knowledge of the subjects discussed, on both practical and theoretical point of view, so please consider the workload properly.</p>
    <h2><a id="Setup_WordPress_with_WAMP_on_the_JKCC_machines_13"></a>Setup WordPress with WAMP on the JKCC machines</h2>
    <p>Using the WAMP server available in ZenDesk on the university machines, please try to install WordPress on the machine. Look at the documentation on the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">Codex</a> if needed. If you encounter any problem, please ask, as this session is helping us to evaluate what we will need to work on during the trimester.</p>
