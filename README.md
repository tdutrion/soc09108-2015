# SOC09108 - Edinburgh Napier University - 2015

This repository contains the lectures for the module SOC09108 taught at Edinburgh Napier University in 2015, on CMSs.

## Content
The main file is the `index.html` that contains the links to all the lectures. Lectures are stored in the `lecture` directory, as a single directory per lecture.

By definition, a lecture is a [RevealJS](http://revealjs.com/) slideshow, so a lecture folder mainly contains an `index.html` file (the slideshow itself), but may also contain images or videos.

The main `/index.html` file is automatically generated by running the `sh generate-index.sh` command, which should be done before pushing data back to the Github repository. You can do that with a pre-commit hook, or by creating a task with Grunt, Gulp, Brunch or other tools that watches the `lecture` directory and triggers the script when required.
